Version 1.5.2
----------------------
- File Parsing
--	Fixed bug where first user in file was skipped due to a legacy header bug
	This originated when I expected all files to be labeled with headers, this is no longer need nor the case so it was removed
- Script Processing
-- Fixed logic bug where inheritance fixed was not skipped when unchecked and skipped when checked
- Internal
-- Fixed cross-boundary thread access bug related to check boxes and e-mail address
-- Fixed bug where if a processed script had been re-run on the same day it would attempt to rename it the same name and crash
-- Fixed thread race bug where the e-mail failing would try to log to the log file that it was trying to send causing nasty failure
-- Improved error handling when a settings file is invalid
